# NPL CLI

This is a command line tool for developers wanting to use the NPL programming language.

## Installation

A better installer is in prograss, but for now you need to clone the GitHub repo and run a script to install the CLI.

### Windows

To install on Microsoft Windows, run the following command script .\installer\win\install

This script will globally install the `npl-cli` nodejs package, create a symbolic link to it in your 
user profile directory, then add `.\installer\win` to your path environment variable.

This directory contains `npl.cmd` which will run the NPL CLI using nodejs.

### MacOS

TBD
