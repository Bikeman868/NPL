# NPL TypeScript Runtime

This is a shared package that sits between a compiled NPL application and the JavaScript runtime. It implements
mechanisms for queuing, routing and processing messages.

Documentation on the NPL language, framework and supporting tools can be found in [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/Bikeman868/NPL).
